 Hello my frineds, today i want to say some about game that i played yesterday.I played a game named "There's only one level".
 * The elephant forgot the rest of the levels, but luckily he still has one left! Help him beat it in all his metagaming glory. Use your keen knowledge of gaming and dexterity to manhandle your way through a variety of challenges. Get your mind out of the box for once! Take it outside for a walk, or maybe grab a bite to eat with it.

Oh, and beat the level. There's only one.

Controls
Arrow keys, but I am told not to tell you any more than that. The elephant says so.
